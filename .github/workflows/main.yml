# Overview of what we need to do:

# 1 - When a issue is labeled as 'suggestion', trigger the workflow.
# 2 - Retrieve the github username of the author of the issue
# 3 - Retrieve the issue's facts
# 4 - Parse the facts and put in a nice json format
# 5 - Read facts database
# 6 - Add the new fact(s) to facts database
# 7 - Overwrite facts database
# 8 - Add, commit, push
# 9 - :)

# Each of these steps introduce a new challenge.
# 1 needs a bit of search to know the syntax.
# 2~3 can be solved with env vars, I think.
# 4~7 are pretty much just plain programming,
# but... node or python? I wouldn't like to deal with npm for now.
# 8... authorizing things is tricky...
